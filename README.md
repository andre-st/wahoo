# Making the Wahoo ELEMNT Bolt v2 more useful

## Basics

- Bolt runs an old Android operating system and is accessible via ADB over USB cable
- there is app.webadb.com via Chrome and WebUSB when you are unable to install adb for some reason (some securtiy/privacy risk though)
- Bolt authorizes ADB in debug mode:
	1. power up without USB-Cable plugged in, 
	2. press POWER+UP+DOWN simultan.
	3. white Bolt LED flashes for a second if successfully
	4. plug in cable
	5. I had to try this 20+ times until this "official" method finally worked; 
		I also pressed UP+DOWN during Bolt's "warm up" phase when it worked



## Points of Interest (POI)

### Motivation

- distance cycling / bikepacking
- requires food, drinking water (cemetery), toilets, shelter (= POI types) along the route
- cyclist might miss nearby POIs, either planned or non-planned


### What's there?

- native function on the device: "Save my location" = no manual coordinates
- adding POIs manually via smartphone companion app = pain
- self generated maps with POI-symbols = best approach but nasty setup and regular (re-)generation needs lot of time

	- https://github.com/yokuha/Wahoo-maps
- custom CUE hints in TCX (not GPX) files will give a text warning when approaching the point + water tap icon
	- RwGPS premium feature? $$$
	- ```xml
		<CoursePoint> 
			<Name>Water</Name> 
			<Time>2023-10-19T17:13:09Z</Time> 
			<Position> 
				<LatitudeDegrees>x.xxxx</LatitudeDegrees> 
				<LongitudeDegrees>y.yyyy</LongitudeDegrees> 
			</Position> 
			<PointType>Water</PointType>   <!-- or: Food, Danger -->
			<Notes>Water!</Notes> 
		</CoursePoint>
		```
- replace with expensive Garmin device
- adding POIs manually by editing the BoltApp database via ADB and a SQLite client = no POI types, all heart-icon only
	- DB-file: `/data/data/com.wahoofitnes.bolt/databases/BoltApp.sqlite`
	- DB-table: `CloudPoiDao`

Here, I try CUEs and BoltApp DB editing **but automate finding POIs along our route** via OpenStreetMap (OSM).
